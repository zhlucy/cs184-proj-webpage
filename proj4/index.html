			The default parameters are <code> density = 15 g/cm^2, ks = 5000 N/m, and damping = 0.2% </code>

			This is what the cloth looks like with these default parameters.

			With <code>density</code> and <code>damping</code> held constant, we can see that as we increase <code>ks</code>, the cloth becomes more stiffer.
			When <code>ks</code> is low, the cloth appears to jiggle more frequently at its rest state; at higher <code>ks</code>, the rest state of the cloth becomes stiffer and less jiggly.

			With <code>ks</code> and <code>damping</code> held constant, we can see that as the density increases, the u-shaped dip on the top of the cloth dips even more.
			At rest state, this u-shaped dip appears to have a smaller dip at low densities while at high densities, the shape dips down further into the cloth.

		<p>
			When <code>ks</code> and <code>density</code> are held constant, a low <code>damping</code> percentage results in the cloth moving more freely.
			In the picture where <code>damping=0</code>, we can see the cloth is in the middle of "sloshing". Furthermore, when the <code>damping</code>> percentage is lower, the cloth seems to be dropping closewr to free fall.
			In compairson, increasing the <code>damping</code> parameter makes the cloth slosh less, and causes the cloth to get to its rest position slower; the cloth drops to its rest position slowly.

			At a lower <code>ks</code>, we can see that the cloth is wrapping the sphere a lot more tightly than when <code>ks</code> is high.
			This is related to the effect that we saw in Part 2; a lower spring constant allows the the cloth to be free and thus more "jiggly". 
			Similarly, in this case, a lower spring constant allows the cloth to wrap around the sphere more tightly.
			On the other hand, a higher spring constant restricts the movement of the cloth, which is why the cloth doesn't wrap itself around the sphere because the higher spring constant restricts the cloth.

			At lower densities, the cloth seems to crumple up less and each fold seems to be bigger. One can see that when <code>density = 1</code>, the cloth has less folds, each fold is large, and the cloth that hasn't been folded yet is relatively smooth.
			On the other hand, at higher densities, the cloth seems to crumple up a lot more and the size of each fold seems to be smaller. At <code>density = 200</code>, the size of each fold is smaller, there are more folds, and the cloth that hasn't been folded yet is already crumpled up.

			When <code>ks</code> is lower, the cloth seems to be more crumpled up at rest state than when the <code>ks</code> is higher.
			When <code>ks = 1</code>, we can see that the cloth is really crumpled up at its rest state.
			In contrast, a higher <code>ks</code> results in a smoother cloth at rest state.
			This is probably due to the fact that a higher <code>ks</code> means a higher spring constant, so the springs are stiffer, meaning a higher <code>ks</code> would mean the springs have less displacement. 
			When <code>ks</code> is lower, the springs have a higher displacement, meaning the cloth is prone to crumple more in its rest state.

			Shader program runs on the GPU and generates the final image with lighting and material effects. Vertex shaders are responsible for processing the geometry of 3D models. They take in information about the position, orientation, and scale of each vertex of a 3D model, and they use this information to transform the vertices into their final positions on the screen. On the other hand, fragment shaders are responsible for processing the fragments calculated by the vertex shader. They take in information about the position, color, and texture of each pixel, and they use this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong model uses a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to create a more realistic lighting effect on the object. Ambient light is the general illumination that is present everywhere in the scene. Diffuse light is the light that is scattered in all directions when it hits a rough surface. Specular light is the light that is reflected in a specific direction when it hits a shiny surface. Each of these are calculated using the formulas given in lecture with surface normal, view direction, and light direction.
