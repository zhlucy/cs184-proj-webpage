		<h2>Part 1</h2>
		<p>
			To generate the ray, we took the (x,y) coordinates that were passed in the world space, and transformed it into the camera space by 
			generating a 3x3 matrix, vecotorizing our input, and multiplying the matrix by the vector.
			In camera space, we generated our ray, and then we used the cw matrix to transform the ray from camera space back to world space, and then we normalized 
			the ray and set its min_t and max_t values.

			To generate the pixel samples, we generated ns_aa random rays by using randomly generated (x,y) coordinates, created normalized vectors, and then 
			used the generate_ray to generate our ray. After generating the ray, we called est_radiance_global_illumination to estimate the scene radiance along that ray and then 
			updated the sampleBuffer accordingly.

			In order to test for intersection, we used the Moller-Trumbore algorithm by creating the vectors and performing dot products and cross products as described from lecture.
			The Moller-Trumbore algorithm finds the barycentric coordinates of the ray if it intersects the triangle. 
			In order to check if the ray hit the triangle, we checked to see if the b1, b2, and (1 - b1 - b2) coordinates were all greater than or equal to 0.
			We then checked to see if the ray hit the triangle within the min_t and max_t bounds by checking to see if t was within these bounds.
			If either the first or second check failed, we simply returned false.
			Otherwise, we updated the ray's max_t value, and then updated the Intersection attributes and returned true.
